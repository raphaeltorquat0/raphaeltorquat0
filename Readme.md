## Raphael Torquato

I design and build systems that need to work  
when scale, latency and complexity stop being theoretical.

14+ years working across architecture, AI and mobile platforms.  
Currently leading technical decisions at stealth AI startups.

### How I think

I care about systems that **survive reality** — not slides.

That usually means:
- explicit architectural trade-offs
- real-time and data-heavy workloads under operational constraints
- platforms engineers can evolve without fear

I’m especially interested in problems where **scale, performance and data**
intersect with real business and regulatory requirements.

### Featured product — IPTU API

**IPTU API** is a production SaaS that provides unified access to official
property tax (IPTU) and real-estate data across major Brazilian cities.

The core platform is private, but its public SDKs reflect how the system
is designed for external consumption — with consistency, performance
and developer experience as first-class concerns.

This product represents how I approach:
- API and platform design
- data ingestion and normalization
- performance, caching and operational trade-offs
- long-term maintainability for external consumers

### Where I spend my time

**System Architecture**  
Distributed systems, event-driven platforms, cloud-native infrastructure

**AI & Real-Time Systems**  
Computer vision pipelines, edge inference, video and data at scale

**Mobile Platforms**  
Native iOS/Android and cross-platform system design
