### Technical focus

My work centers on **production-grade systems** where architecture,
performance and reliability are first-order concerns.

Typical problem spaces include:
- distributed and event-driven architectures
- real-time and data-heavy workloads
- platforms designed for long-term evolution and operational stability

I am particularly interested in environments where **technical decisions
directly impact business outcomes, compliance and operational risk**.

### Featured product — IPTU API  
**Production Data Platform & Public API**

**IPTU API** is a production SaaS that provides unified access to official
property tax (IPTU) and real-estate data across major Brazilian cities.

While the core platform is private, its public SDKs and interfaces reflect
the architectural principles used for external consumption:
consistency, performance, reliability and developer experience.

This product represents work on:
- platform and API architecture
- large-scale data ingestion and normalization
- caching, performance and cost trade-offs
- operational reliability in regulated environments
- long-term maintainability for external consumers
